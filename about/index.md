## About

Our mission is to create and publicize opportunities for UC students and the general public to explore interdisciplinary animal studies, which encompasses scholarship from fields including but not limited to anthropology, critical theory, ecology, animal law & ethics, performance studies, environmental humanities, and evolutionary biology. Increased awareness about animal studies will motivate changes in students’ behavior towards an ethic of care and moral consideration for other beings and create demand for policy changes necessary to increase quality of life across species.

* We will provide resources including a public website, reading lists, and sample syllabi for student-led courses to **promote critical assessments of key issues and concepts in the fields.**
* We will collaborate with UC faculty to **develop animal studies curricula** at each campus.
* We will research and **share non-UC events and opportunities related to animal studies,** including conferences and journals.
* In collaboration with Minding Animals International, we aim to establish a Minding Animals California chapter to **create a network of students, faculty, and other scholars pursuing research in animal studies.**

We aim to highlight sources that represent a variety of perspectives and methodologies, including creative works. Many of the texts featured represent our interest in critical animal studies, which is modeled off the urgencies of fields such as disability studies, critical race theory, and gender/sexuality studies. CAS critiques categorical animality as a construction that serves to partition “humans” and “animals” to violent ends, and operates with the base assumption that other forms of life, even if they are drastically different from our own, deserve recognition as persons (while at the same time questioning what exactly we mean by the term *person*). A proper approach to CAS *must* be intersectional -- decolonial, anti-racist, queer, anti-ableist, feminist, anti-capitalist, etc. -- and as such, it needs to be reflexive on its own histories and histories of (North American) animal rights advocacy and activism (which have been, historically, overwhelmingly white).

We also strive to emphasize the scientific background needed to engage critically with issues around human and non-human animal interactions. We believe that an interdisciplinary perspective on animal studies involves an understanding of evolution, ecology, and other biological sciences, as well as the possibilities and limitations of these fields as they pertain to other animals. Those pursuing animal studies should seek to gain confidence in using scientific approaches to solving problems and in analyzing scholarship that utilizes empirical methodologies. Key issues relevant to animal studies to be examined through a scientific lens include: antibiotic resistance, global warming/climate change, pollution, anthropogenic effects on ecosystems, modeling of population data, genetic variance and gene conservation between species, developmental biology, bioethics, and medical uses of animals for drug development, tissue generation, and organ transplants. Animal studies presents a unique opportunity to synthesize scholarship ranging from biology to literature, and the UC Animal Studies Initiative aims to provide the tools for readers to draw connections across a wide body of work.

We acknowledge that the resources and reference material provided through this website are by no means comprehensive, and are always seeking more resources that reflect our goal of building an interdisciplinary, intersectional reading list. To this end, we encourage suggestions on how we might improve our site to better include a well-rounded set of perspectives, and invite contributions (literature recommendations, additional external resources, information on relevant upcoming events, etc.) from readers. Contact us with questions, comments, or suggested resources [here](/contact).
